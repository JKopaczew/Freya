# Freya

This is just a hobby project to learn Vulkan and graphics rendering. I will mostly be following tutorials and online resources, who knows, maybe something interesting will come of this.

## Purpose

Draw pretty 3d objects on the screen supper efficiently. Probably going to start with something simple, like a nice triangle! 

## Support

Currently only targets Windows x64 devices with modern vulkan drivers. Will probably play around so i can learn how to make cross platform software, but thats in the future. 

## Prerequisites

The renderer is written using Visual Studio 2019 cummunity and Vulkan SDK (SDK must be added to system PATH).

## Building

In order to build and run the project, clone this repository using --recursive flag as git submodules are utilised

	git clone https://github.com/jkopaczew/freya.git --recursive

I use Vulkan SDK version 1.2.141.2

## Road-map

TBD

### Future support

   * Support Windows x86 (if time permits)
   * Linux compatibility
   * Mac compatibility (maybe)

### Current working on

   * Following https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Base_code to learn basics.
